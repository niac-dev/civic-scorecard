This resolution, drafted after the 12-day war between Iran and Israel, aims to reassert Congress’s authority and prevent the U.S. from being pulled into a war with Iran. Unlike the Massie-Khanna version, it includes an exception allowing U.S. forces to ‘defend the United States or an ally or partner.’ The concern is that this broad exception could be used to justify U.S. involvement in military actions triggered by Israel—even when no real or imminent threat exists—similar to the circumstances that led to Israel’s initial bombing of Iran in June 2025.”",4,2025-06-23,https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/40,,0,,
