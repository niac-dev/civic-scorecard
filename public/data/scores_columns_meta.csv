H.Con.Res.38 — Iran War Powers Resolution (Preferred),BILL,H.Con.Res.38,H.Con.Res.38 — Iran War Powers Resolution (Preferred),Iran,cosponsor,Iran War Powers Resolution (Preferred),,M001184,"Massie, Thomas",SUPPORT,true,pair_1:H.Con.Res.38|H.Con.Res.40,HOUSE,The key House resolution opposing unauthorized war with Iran.,"This legislation is critical for preventing U.S. involvement in war with Iran, particularly in light of the Trump administration's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on June 21, 2025, during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel. The bill also serves as a strong messaging tool within Congress and the wider public that there is no military solution to resolving the nuclear issue with Iran."

It does however include an exception for enabling Armed Forces to ""defend the United States or an ally or partner of the United States."" The concern with this exception is that it could be easily manipulated to justify acts of aggression initiated by Israel, a key ally and partner of the United States, against Iran, particularly when there may not necessarily a legitimate threat. These were the circumstances that led to Israel's initial bombing of Iran in June 2025 in the first place."
H.R. 1422 — Enhanced Iran Sanctions Act,BILL,H.R. 1422,H.R. 1422 — Enhanced Iran Sanctions Act,Iran,cosponsor,Enhanced Iran Sanctions Act,,L000599,"Lawler, Michael",OPPOSE,,,HOUSE,Doubles down on failed maximum pressure policies that primarily hurt ordinary Iranian civilians.,"This bill would impose new sanctions on actors with minimal connection to trade related to Iranian oil. Critically, the bill would offer minimal discretion to the President on sanctions policy, and would require an act of Congress to halt after 2029, making it significantly more difficult for a successor administration to use existing leverage to conduct diplomacy or sustain any agreement struck in the coming years."

Its sole purpose is to eliminate a sunset in the Iran Sanctions Act - core sanctions targeting Iran’s energy sector - that is not due to expire until December 31, 2026. While provisions of the Iran Sanctions Act were waived under the Iran nuclear deal for a brief period, it has been extended twice already since its original passage in 1996. U.S. leverage will not be enhanced by H.R. 1800, and there is risk that its passage could worsen an already complicated/absent negotiating environment."

This resolution, introduced nearly every single Congress, merely endorses Maryam Rajavi, the MEK's leader -- who is directly referenced in the bill's text -- while effectively doing nothing to actually provide tangible support and solutions for the people of Iran."
