H.Con.Res.38 — War Powers Resolution (Massie-Khanna),BILL,H.Con.Res.38,Iran,War Powers Resolution (Massie-Khanna),"This legislation is critical for preventing U.S. involvement in war with Iran, particularly in light of the Trump administration's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on June 21, 2025, during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel. The bill also serves as a strong messaging tool within Congress and the wider public that there is no military solution to resolving the nuclear issue with Iran.",,SUPPORT,true,pair_1:H.Con.Res.38|H.Con.Res.40
H.Con.Res.40 — War Powers Resolution (Meeks-Smith),BILL,H.Con.Res.40,Iran,War Powers Resolution (Meeks-Smith),"This resolution, also drafted in the aftermath of the 12-day war between Iran and Israel, is grounded in the same core constitutional concern of asserting congressional war powers in order to prevent war with Iran, just like the Massie-Khanna version. It does however include an exception for enabling Armed Forces to ""defend the United States or an ally or partner of the United States."" The concern with this exception is that it could be easily manipulated to justify acts of aggression initiated by Israel, a key ally and partner of the United States, against Iran, particularly when there may not necessarily a legitimate threat. These were the circumstances that led to Israel's initial bombing of Iran in June 2025 in the first place.",,SUPPORT,false,pair_1:H.Con.Res.38|H.Con.Res.40
H.R. 1422 — Enhanced Iran Sanctions Act(Lawler),BILL,H.R. 1422,Iran,Enhanced Iran Sanctions Act(Lawler),"This bill would impose new sanctions on actors with minimal connection to trade related to Iranian oil. Critically, the bill would offer minimal discretion to the President on sanctions policy, and would require an act of Congress to halt after 2029, making it significantly more difficult for a successor administration to use existing leverage to conduct diplomacy or sustain any agreement struck in the coming years.",,OPPOSE,,
H.R.1576 — Protecting American Agriculture from Foreign Adversaries Act of 2025,BILL,H.R.1576,Civil Rights,Protecting American Agriculture from Foreign Adversaries Act of 2025,,,OPPOSE,,
H.R.1800 — Solidify Iran Sanctions Act (Mackenzie),BILL,H.R.1800,Iran,Solidify Iran Sanctions Act (Mackenzie),"This legislation is wholly unnecessary. Its sole purpose is to eliminate a sunset in the Iran Sanctions Act - core sanctions targeting Iran’s energy sector - that is not due to expire until December 31, 2026. While provisions of the Iran Sanctions Act were waived under the Iran nuclear deal for a brief period, it has been extended twice already since its original passage in 1996. U.S. leverage will not be enhanced by H.R. 1800, and there is risk that its passage could worsen an already complicated/absent negotiating environment.",,OPPOSE,,

H.R.4281 — Bunker Buster Act (Gottheimer-Lawler),BILL,H.R.4281,Iran,Bunker Buster Act (Gottheimer-Lawler),"Introduced in the aftermath of the 12-day war between Iran and Israel, this bill essentially expresses support for the nuclear-related justifications under which Israel initiated its illegal attack against Iran in June 2025, killing hundreds of civilians and affirms support for such an approach should Israel choose to do so again in the future.",,OPPOSE,,

H.Res.166 — MEK Bill (McClintock),BILL,H.Res.166,Iran,MEK Bill (McClintock),"This bill is directly affiliated with the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), which was a formerly designated terrorist organization which has operated as a cult known for committing gross human rights violations against its members. This resolution, introduced nearly every single Congress, merely endorses Maryam Rajavi, the MEK's leader -- who is directly referenced in the bill's text -- while effectively doing nothing to actually provide tangible support and solutions for the people of Iran.",,OPPOSE,,
H.Res.521 — Standing with Israel attack on Iran,BILL,H.Res.521,Iran,Standing with Israel attack on Iran,"This resolution expresses support for Israel's bombing campaign inside Iran in June 2025, completely ignoring the hundreds of Iranian civilians who were killed in the attacks initiated by Israel.",,OPPOSE,,

S.2087 — No War Against Iran Act (Sanders),BILL,S.2087,Iran,No War Against Iran Act (Sanders),"This bill is essential in actually working to preempt military action against Iran, while War Powers Resolutions are often raised once military action has already been pursued. A bill like this, along with a solid War Powers Resolution go hand in hand in creating a strong legislative precedent for preventing any kind of war/military confrontation with Iran.",,SUPPORT,,

Critically, the bill would offer minimal discretion to the President on sanctions policy, and would require an act of Congress to halt after 2029, making it significantly more difficult for a successor administration to use existing leverage to conduct diplomacy or sustain any agreement struck in the coming years.",,OPPOSE,,

The bill also serves as a strong messaging tool within Congress and the wider public that there is no military solution to resolving the nuclear issue with Iran. While this measure did not pass during its attempted vote, a notable number of Democrats voted in favor of the resolution.",,SUPPORT,,
